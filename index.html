            <p> The end of Neymar's career was marked by a mix of brilliance, injuries, and unfulfilled potential. While still showcasing glimpses of his genius, persistent injuries began to take a toll, limiting his impact on the pitch. His time at Paris Saint-Germain ended with growing frustrations, as he struggled to lead them to Champions League glory despite flashes of individual brilliance. A high-profile move to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia signaled the winding down of his time at the top levels of European football, shifting the focus from competition to commercial appeal. Though still a global icon, the latter years of his career lacked the same explosiveness.</p>
